I am extremely grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Edward Anstead who has given me advice, guidance, and encouragement during the project. All the comments given by the supervisor was valuable for me to improve my project and my report. Furthermore, I would like to thank my uncle who has been working closely with me during this project and giving me useful ideas as well as what their requirement in the program. His support was very useful for me to make the correct program as need in his business. I also like to thanks my wonderful parents who always cared for, loved, and supportive of all the work I do in my life.
