Inventory check is a web-based application for managing the inventory for the business. The user needs to add all the product information manually using the add product form and all this data will be stored in the database securely. The application utilises six various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and API.\newline
\newline The use of inventory system is widely used by retailers/other industry and research shows that every single business use this system to manage their inventory such as eBay, Amazon, Sainsbury's, Tesco, etc. This has allowed me to take completely new approaches by solving the current problems using the system as the inventory management system widely used by a big company and no one has thought about the smaller business who cannot afford to pay big fees every year, therefore, I have made a suitable, secure and easy to use the system for smaller business and there will be no fees to use my system. This system will make it easier for them to track down the out of the stock item, analysis the profit, sales, check the number of item in stocks, fast selling item and more.\newline
\newline By developing a system that allows the user to see the data in real-time with database and Internet technology, this project shows the potential of use in other industries, not only in retail. Prototyping and design took place with different databases servers such as XAMPP or MongoDB, concluding with using XAMPP to implement the system.
